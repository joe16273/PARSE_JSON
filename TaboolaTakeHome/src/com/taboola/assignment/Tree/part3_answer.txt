In order to support other data types, we can make use of Generics. The declaration of the node class would be like this: public class Node<T>. Then we will also have to make the TreeSerializer interface generic and edit the methods accordingly. 

Another way which we could try that came into my mind while doing the first question was if we use a format like JSON for serialization. I am not sure if this would work but it sounds like an interesting approach.
