# Taboola_TakeHome_Assignment
Hello!
This repository is divided in the following way:
1. The SQL_QUESTION folder contains the asnwer to the third question. I have included one file which contains all the tables and the query.
2. The TaboolaTakeHome folder contains asnwers to the other two questions in Java.The JSON PARSER is in the folder called JSON which has a class called JSONLexer which converts the JSON string to an array of tokens. Then the array of tokens is fed into JSONParser which parses the tokens and returns a map. There is also a testing class JSONParserTester.
3. The Tree folder has the solution to the serializing and deserializing questions. It has the interface TreeSerializer, the class Node, the class TreeSer which contains code for the first part. The TreeSerExp contains code for the second part (throwing excpetion if a cycle is in the tree). Then there are also testing classes for both of them. The answer to the last part is in the.txt file.
Thank you!
